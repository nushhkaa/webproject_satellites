            <p class="question" id="q1" > WHAT IS A SATELLITE? </p>
            <p class="answer">
            A satellite is a moon, planet or machine that orbits a planet or star. For example, Earth is a satellite because it orbits the sun. Likewise, the moon is a satellite because it orbits Earth. Usually, the word "satellite" refers to a machine that is launched into space and moves around Earth or another body in space.</p>
            <p class="answer">
            Earth and the moon are examples of natural satellites. Thousands of artificial, or man-made, satellites orbit Earth. Some take pictures of the planet that help meteorologists predict weather and track hurricanes. Some take pictures of other planets, the sun, black holes, dark matter or faraway galaxies. These pictures help scientists better understand the solar system and universe.</p>
            <p class="answer">
            Still other satellites are used mainly for communications, such as beaming TV signals and phone calls around the world. A group of more than 20 satellites make up the Global Positioning System, or GPS. If you have a GPS receiver, these satellites can help figure out your exact location.

            <p class="question"  id="q2" >WHICH WAS THE FIRST SATELLITE IN SPACE?</p> 
            <p class="answer">
                The first artificial satellite was Sputnik 1, a Russian beach-ball-size space probe that lifted off on Oct. 4, 1957.</p> 
        
            <p class="answer">
                Following that feat, on Nov. 3, 1957 the Soviets launched an even more massive satellite — Sputnik 2 — which carried a dog, Laika. The United States' first satellite was Explorer 1 on Jan. 31, 1958. </p>
        
            <p class="question" id="q3" > WHAT ARE THE PARTS OF A SATELLITE?</p> 
            <p class="answer">
                Every usable artificial satellite — whether it's a human or robotic one — has four main parts to it: a power system (which could be solar or nuclear, for example), a way to control its attitude, an antenna to transmit and receive information, and a payload to collect information (such as a camera or particle detector)</p>
        
            <p class="question" id="q4" > WHAT KEEPS A SATELLITE FROM FALLING TO EARTH? </p>
            <p class="answer">
                A satellite is best understood as a projectile, or an object that has only one force acting on it — gravity. Technically speaking, anything that crosses the Karman Line at an altitude of 100 kilometers (62 miles) is considered in space. However, a satellite needs to be going fast — at least 8 km (5 miles) a second — to stop from falling back down to Earth immediately.</p>
            <p class="answer">
                There are several accepted "zones" of orbits around the Earth. </p>
            <p class="answer">  
                One is called low-Earth-orbit, which extends from about 160 to 2,000 km (about 100 to 1,250 miles). This is the zone where the ISS orbits and where the space shuttle used to do its work.</p>
                
            <p class="answer">
                Geostationary or geosynchronous orbit is the best spot for communications satellites to use, however. This is a zone above Earth's equator at an altitude of 35,786 km (22,236 mi). At this altitude, the rate of "fall" around the Earth is about the same as Earth's rotation, which allows the satellite to stay above the same spot on Earth almost constantly. The satellite thus keeps a perpetual connection with a fixed antenna on the ground, allowing for reliable communications.</p>
                
            <p class="answer">
                While some satellites are best used around the equator, others are better suited to more polar orbits — those that circle the Earth from pole to pole so that their coverage zones include the north and south poles. Examples of polar-orbiting satellites include weather satellites and reconnaissance satellites.</p>
         
            <p class="question" id="q5" >  WHAT STOPS A SATELLITE FROM CRASHING INTO ANOTHER SATELLITE? </p>
            <p class="answer">
                There is a lot of "space junk" floating around out there in space. With an increasing amount of satellites that are now circling the earth, the chance of a collision increases.    </p> 
            <p class="answer">
                Space agencies have to consider orbital trajectories carefully when launching something into space. Agencies such as the United States Space Surveillance Network keep an eye on orbital debris from the ground and alert NASA.</p>
            
            <p class="answer">
                Collisions still occur, however. One of the biggest culprits of space debris was the leftovers of a 2007 anti-satellite test performed by the Chinese, which generated debris that destroyed a Russian satellite in 2013. Also that year, the Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251 satellites smashed into each other, generating a cloud of debris.</p>
